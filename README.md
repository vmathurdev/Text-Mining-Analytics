# Text-Mining-Analytics
The claims descriptions, recorded in free text by claims managers for the most unusual claims, can be leveraged to enhance the understanding of large, uncertain claims. This also allows the actuaries to manage individual claims data in a flexible way to extract information in an efficient manner.


# Instruction for execution
1. Prepare file for input to R (e.g. notepad of claims descriptions.
   In SQL, to output to file, go to Query --> Results To --> Results to File, then run query and pick save location)
   Typically, save this file in R text mining\Files
   Move older input files to the "Archive" folder, otherwise they will be included in the latest analysis

2. Download R package for free

3. Run the code in this file section by section
   (sections demarcated by ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////)

4. Output will be saved here: \R text mining\Text mining MICRO_NOTES_text_mining.csv
   (rename file once happy with it, otherwise file will be overwritten by future textmining endeavours)
